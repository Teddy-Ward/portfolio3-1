# Introducing My New Tier Price List

I'm excited to announce my new tier price list as a self-employed web developer! I've been working as a freelance web developer for the past few years, and I've built up a lot of experience with the MERN tech stack. I'm also familiar with Tailwind, Next.js, and TypeScript.

In addition to my experience with the MERN tech stack, I am also proficient in React Native. React Native is a framework that allows you to create native mobile apps using JavaScript. This means that your app will look and feel like it was built natively for iOS or Android, without the need for a separate codebase for each platform.

I am also able to update and fix websites, offer maintenance or redesign. This includes tasks such as:

- Fixing bugs
- Adding new features
- Improving performance
- Updating the design
- Migrating to a new platform

My new tier price list is based on the complexity of the project and the amount of time it will take me to complete. I offer six tiers:

- **Basic:** This tier is for simple projects that require basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. The price for this tier is £99.
- **Standard:** This tier is for more complex projects that require more advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. The price for this tier is £299.
- **Complete:** This tier is for the most complex projects that require a deep understanding of the MERN tech stack, React, and experience with Tailwind, Next.js, and TypeScript. The price for this tier is £599.
- **E-Commerce:** This tier is for the shop and store projects that require the deep understanding of the tech stack. It includes a safe and secure payment area. The price for this tier is £999.
- **Community:** This tier is for the a large business or social projects that require the member and admin areas, allowing data or subjects to be shared as required. The price for this tier is £2599.
- **Phone App:** This is a tier for the creation of a phone application in React Native, this includes getting app on marketplaces for future income and ad revenue. The price for this tier is £4999.

I also offer for all projects one year hosting, domain name and support.  If you hire me to work on multiple projects, I will give you a discount on the total price.

I'm confident that I can provide you with high-quality web development services at a reasonable price. If you have a project in mind, please contact me for a free consultation.

Here are some of my skills and experience:

- Familiar with the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Experience with Tailwind, Next.js, and TypeScript
- Strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team
- Excellent communication and problem-solving skills
- Proficient in React Native
- Ability to update and fix websites, offer maintenance or redesign

I'm looking forward to working with you on your next web development project!
