# What is CRUD?

**CRUD** stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of four basic operations that are used to manage data in a database. CRUD operations are used in a wide variety of applications, including web applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications.

### Create

The Create operation is used to add new data to a database. For example, you might use the Create operation to add a new customer to a customer database.

### Read

The Read operation is used to retrieve data from a database. For example, you might use the Read operation to retrieve a list of customers from a customer database.

### Update

The Update operation is used to modify existing data in a database. For example, you might use the Update operation to change the address of a customer in a customer database.

### Delete

The Delete operation is used to remove data from a database. For example, you might use the Delete operation to remove a customer from a customer database.


## CRUD and REST

CRUD operations are often used in conjunction with RESTful APIs. RESTful APIs are a way of exposing data from a database over the internet. When you use a RESTful API, you can use CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

## CRUD and User Interfaces

CRUD operations can also be used to create user interfaces for databases. For example, you might use CRUD operations to create a form that allows users to create new customers in a customer database.

### Conclusion

CRUD is a fundamental concept in database management. CRUD operations are used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. CRUD operations can also be used to create user interfaces for databases.
